== Memory-mapped register interface

The IOMMU provides a memory-mapped programming interface. The memory-mapped 
registers of each IOMMU are located within a naturally aligned 4-KiB region 
(a page) of physical address space. 

The IOMMU behavior for register accesses where the address is not aligned to 
the size of the access or if the access spans multiple registers is undefined.

The reset default value of register fields is 0 unless explicitly noted 
otherwise in the register definition.

Register fields are assigned one of the attributes described in following 
table.

^|Attribute    ^|                      Description
| RW            | Read-Write - Register bits are read-write and are permitted 
                  to be either Set or Cleared by software to the desired state.

                  If the optional feature that is associated with the bits is 
                  not implemented, the bits are permitted to be hardwired to
                  Zero.
| RO            | Read-only - Register bits are read-only and cannot be altered
                  by software. Where explicitly defined, these bits are used
                  to reflect changing hardware state, and as a result bit 
                  values can be observed to change at run time.

                  If the optional feature that would Set the bits is not 
                  implemented, the bits must be hardwired to Zero
| RW1C          | Write-1-to-clear status - Register bits indicate status when 
                  read. A Set bit indicates a status event which is Cleared by
                  writing a 1b. Writing a 0b to RW1C bits has no effect.

                  If the optional feature that would Set the bit is not 
                  implemented, the bit must be read-only and hardwired to Zero
| WPRI          | Reserved Writes Preserve Values, Reads Ignore Values. See
                  RISC-V privileged specification for a detailed definition.
| WARL          | Write Any Values, Reads Legal Values. See RISC-V privileged 
                  specification for a detailed definition.

[[FCTRL]]
=== Features-control register (`fctrl`)

This register must be readable in any implementation. An implementation may 
allow one or more fields in the register to be writeable to support enabling
or disabling the feature corresponding to that field.

If a `fctrl` field is writeable then the corresponding feature may be 
enabled or disabled by updating that field.

When software enables or disables a feature when the IOMMU is not OFF 
(i.e. `ddtp.iommu_mode == Off`) then the IOMMU behavior is `UNSPECIFIED`.

The device-context is 64-bytes in size if `capabilities.MSI_FLAT` is 1 else it is 
32-bytes.

When the 'iommu_mode' is 'Bare' or `Off`, the `PPN` field is don't-care.

All IOMMU must support `Off` and `Bare` mode. An IOMMU is allowed to support a 
subset of directory-table levels and device-context widths. At a minimum one 
of the modes must be supported.

When the `iommu_mode` field value is changed the IOMMU guarantees that 
in-flight transactions from devices connected to the IOMMU will be processed 
with the configurations applicable to the old value of the `iommu_mode` field 
and that all transactions and previous requests from devices that have already 
been processed by the IOMMU be committed to a global ordering point such that 
they can be observed by all RISC-V hart, devices, and IOMMUs in the platform.

[NOTE]
====
The reset default for the `iommu_mode` is recommended to be `Off`.

                              Changing `pqen` from 0 to 1, resets the `pqh`

                              `pqof` to 0. The page request queue may take 
                              some time to be active following setting the 
                              `pqen` to 1. When the page-request-queue is

                              reads 0.

                              When `pqon` reads 0, the IOMMU guarantees that

The `OF` bit is set when the corresponding `iohpmctr*` overflows, and remains set until written by software. Since `iohpmctr*` values are unsigned values, overflow is defined as unsigned overflow. Note that there is no loss of information after an overflow since the counter wraps around and keeps counting while the sticky OF bit remains set.

If an `iohpmctr*` overflows while the associated `OF` bit is zero, then a HPM Counter Overflow interrupt is generated. If the `OF` bit is one, then no interrupt request is generated. Consequently the `OF` bit also functions as a count overflow interrupt disable for the associated `iohpmctr*`.

NOTE: There are not separate overflow status and overflow interrupt enable bits. In practice, enabling overflow interrupt generation (by clearing the `OF` bit) is done in conjunction with initializing the counter to a starting value. Once a counter has overflowed, it and the `OF` bit must be reinitialized before another overflow interrupt can be generated.

This HPM Counter Overflow interrupt (OR of all `iohpmctr*` overflows) is controlled and reported through `ipcsr` register.

[[CONF]]
=== Counters reserved for confidential mode usage (`iocntconf`)

Reserved for future standard use.

[[ICVEC]]
=== Interrupt-cause-to-vector register (`icvec`)

Interrupt-cause-to-vector Register maps a cause to a vector.  All causes can be mapped to same vector or a cause can be given a unique vector. The vector is used

- For MSI capable IOMMU: index into MSI configuration table (`msi_cfg_tbl`).
- For non-MSI capable IOMMU drive a wire

If an implementation only supports a single vector then all bits of this register can be made hardwired to 0 (WARL). Likewise if only two vectors are supported then only bit 0 for each cause could be RW.

[[MSI]]
=== MSI configuration table (`msi_cfg_tbl`)
IOMMU that supports MSI implements a MSI configuration table that is indexed 
by the vector from `icvec` to determine a MSI table entry. Each MSI table 
entry for interrupt vector `x` has three registers `msi_addr_x`, `msi_data_x`, 
and `msi_vec_ctrl_x`. These registers are hard wired to 0 if the IOMMU does 
not support MSI.
