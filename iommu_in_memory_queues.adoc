== In-memory queue interface
Software and IOMMU interact using 3 in-memory queue data structures. 

* A command-queue (CQ) used by software to queue commands to the IOMMU.

* A fault/event queue (FQ) used by IOMMU to bring faults and events to 
  software attention..

* A page-request queue (PQ) used by IOMMU to report “Page Request” messages 
  received from PCIe devices connected to the IOMMU. This queue is supported 
  if the IOMMU supports PCIe ATS specification.

....
Each queue is a circular buffer with a head controlled by the consumer of data
in the queue and a tail controlled by the producer of data into the queue.
IOMMU is the producer of records into PQ and FQ and controls the tail register.
IOMMU is the consumer of commands produced by software into the CQ and controls
the head register. 

A queue is empty if the head is equal to the tail. A queue is full if the tail
is one minus the head. The head and tail wrap around when they reach the end of
the circular buffer.

The producer of data must ensure that the data written to queue memory and the
tail update are ordered such that the consumer that observes an update to the 
tail register must also observe all data produced into the queue between the 
offsets determined by the head and the tail. 

[NOTE]
====
All RISC-V IOMMU implementations are required to support in-memory queues 
located in main memory. Supporting in-memory queues in I/O memory not required.

=== Command-Queue (CQ)

Command  queue is used by software to queue commands to be executed by the 
IOMMU.

The PPN of the base of this in-memory queue and the size of the queue is 
configured into a memory-mapped register called command-queue base (`cqb`).

The tail of the command-queue resides in a software controlled read/write 
memory-mapped register called command-queue tail (`cqt`). The `cqt` is an 
index into the next command queue entry that software will write. Subsequent 
to writing the command(s), software advances the `cqt` by the count of the 
number of commands written. 

The head of the command-queue resides in a read-only memory-mapped IOMMU 
controlled register called command-queue head (`cqh`). The `cqh` is an index 
into the command that IOMMU should process next. Subsequent to processing 
each command IOMMU advances the `cqh` by 1. If `cqh` == `cqt`, the 
command-queue is empty. If `cqt` == (`cqh` - 1) the command-queue is full.

IOMMU commands are grouped into a major command group determined by the `opcode`
and within each group the `func3` field specifies the function invoked by that 
command. The `opcode` defines format of the operand fields. One or more of those
fields may be used by the specific function invoked.

IOMMU operations cause implicit reads and writes to PDT, first-stage and 
second-stage page tables; however these implicit references are ordinarily not
ordered with respect to explicit load and stores to these data structures by 
the RISC-V hart in the machine. 

The IOMMU translation-table cache invalidation commands, IOTINVAL.VMA and 
IOTINVAL.GVMA synchronize updates to in-memory first-stage and second-stage 
page table data structures with the operation of the IOMMU and flush the 
matching IOATC entries.

The `GV` operand indicates if the guest Soft-context ID (`GSCID`) operand is valid.
The `PSCV` operand indicates if the process soft-context ID (`PSCID`) operand is 
valid. Setting `PSCV` to 1 is valid only with `IOTINVAL.VMA`. The `AV` operand 
indicates if the address (`ADDR`) operand is valid. When `GV` is 0, the translations 
associated with the host i.e. those where the second-stage translation is not 
active are operated on.

`IOTINVAL.VMA` guarantees that previous stores made to the first-stage page 
tables by the harts are observed before all subsequent implicit reads from 
IOMMU to the corresponding first-stage page tables.

`IOTINVAL.GVMA` guarantees that previous stores made to the second-stage page 
tables are observed before all subsequent implicit reads from IOMMU to the 
corresponding second-stage page tables. Setting `PSCV` to 1 with IOTINVAL.GVMA
is illegal.

[NOTE]
====
Implementations that cache VA to PA translations may ignore the 
guest-physical-address in `ADDR` operand of `IOTINVAL.GVMA`, when valid, and 
perform an invalidation of all virtual-addresses in VM address spaces 
identified by the `GSCID` operand if valid or all host address spaces if the 
`GSCID` operand is not valid.

Simpler implementations may ignore the operand of `IOTINVAL.VMA` and/or 
`IOTINVAL.GVMA` and always perform a global invalidation across all address 
spaces.

IOMMU operations cause implicit reads and writes to DDT and/or PDT; however 
these implicit references are ordinarily not ordered with respect to explicit 
load or store to DDT or PDT by the RISC-V harts in the machine. 

[[IDDT]]

The IOMMU DDT cache invalidation command, `IODIR.INVAL_DDT` synchronize updates 
to DDT with the operation of the IOMMU and flush the matching cached entries.

[[IPDT]]

The IOMMU PDT cache invalidation command, `IODIR.INVAL_PDT` synchronize updates 
to PDT with the operation of the IOMMU and flush the matching cached entries.

The `DV` operand indicates if the device ID (`DID`) operand is valid.

`IODIR.INVAL_DDT` guarantees that any previous stores made by a RISC-V hart to 
the DDT are observed before all subsequent implicit reads from IOMMU to DDT. 
If `DV` is 0, then the command invalidates all  DDT and PDT entries cached for 
all devices. If `DV` is 1, then the command invalidates cached leaf level DDT 
entry for the device identified by `DID` operand and all associated PDT entries.
The `PID` operand is reserved for `IODIR.INVAL_DDT`.

`IODIR.INVA_PDT` guarantees that any previous stores made by a RISC-V hart to 
the PDT are observed before all subsequent implicit reads from IOMMU to PDT. 
The command invalidates leaf PDT entry for the specified `PID` and `DID`.

....

The IOMMU fetches commands from the CQ in order but the IOMMU may execute the 
fetched commands out of order. The IOMMU advancing `cqh` is not a guarantee 
that the commands fetched by the IOMMU have been executed or committed. 

A `IOFENCE.C` command guarantees that all previous commands fetched from the CQ 
have been completed and committed. 

The commands may be used to order memory accesses from I/O devices connected to
the IOMMU as viewed by the IOMMU, other RISC-V harts, and external devices or 
coprocessors. The `PR` and `PW` bits can be used to request that the IOMMU ensure 
that all previous requests from devices that have already been processed by the
IOMMU be committed to a global ordering point such that they can be observed by
all RISC-V harts and IOMMUs in the machine. 

The wired-interrupt-signaling (`WIS`) bit when set to 1 causes a wired-interrupt
from the command queue to be generated on completion of `IOFENCE.C`. This bit is
reserved if the IOMMU supports MSI.

[NOTE]
====
Software should ensure that all previous read and writes processed by the IOMMU
have been committed to a global ordering point before reclaiming memory made 
accessible to a device. A safe sequence for such memory reclamation is to first
update the page tables to disallow access to the memory from the device and 
then use the `IOTINVAL.VMA` or `IOTINVAL.GVMA` appropriately to synchronize the 
IOMMU with the update to the page table. As part of the synchronization if the
memory reclaimed was previously made read accessible to the device then request
ordering of all previous reads; else if the memory reclaimed was previously 
made write accessible to the device then request ordering of all previous 
reads and writes to the IOFENCE. Ordering previous reads may be required if 
the reclaimed memory will be used to hold data that must not be made visible 
to the device.

The ordering guarantees are made for accesses to main-memory. For accesses to 
I/O memory, the ordering guarantees are implementation and I/O protocol 
defined.

Simpler implementations may unconditionally order all previous memory accesses
globally.
====

The `AV` command operand indicates if `ADDR` operand and DATA operands are valid. 
If `AV`=1, the IOMMU writes `DATA` to memory at a 4-byte aligned address in `ADDR` 
operand as a 4-byte store. 

[NOTE]
====
Software may configure the ADDR command operand to specify the address of the 
sereipnum_le/seteipnum_be in an IMSIC to cause an external interrupt 
notification on `IOFENCE.C` completion. Alternatively, software may program ADDR
to a memory location and use `IOFENCE.C` to set a flag in memory indicating 
command completion.

IOMMU operations cause implicit reads and writes to the MSI page table; however
these implicit references are ordinarily not ordered with respect to explicit 
loads or stores to these data structures by the RISC-V harts in the machine. 

`IOTINVAL.MSI` synchronizes updates to the MSI page table with the operation of 
the IOMMU and invalidates the matching cache entries.

The `PSCV` operand is reserved and must be 0 for `IOTINVAL.MSI`.

  {bits: 64, name: 'PAYLOAD'},
], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024, fontsize:12}}
....
The `ATS.INVAL` command instructs the IOMMU to send a “Invalidation Request” 
message to the PCIe device function identified by RID. An 
“Invalidation Request” message is used to clear a specific subset of the 
address range from the address translation cache in a device function. The 
ATS.INVAL command completes when an “Invalidation Completion” response message
is received from the device or a protocol defined timeout occurs while waiting
for a response. The IOMMU may advance the `cqh` and fetch more commands from 
CQ while a response is awaited. 

[NOTE]
====
Software that needs to know if the invalidation operation completed on the 
device may use the IOMMU command-queue fence command (IOFENCE.C) to wait for 
the responses to all prior “Invalidation Request” messages. The IOFENCE.C is 
guaranteed to not complete before all previously fetched commands were executed
and completed. A previously fetched ATS command to invalidate device ATC does 
not complete till either the request times out or a valid response is received
from the device.
====

The `ATS.PRGR` command instructs the IOMMU to send a “Page Group Response” 
message to the PCIe device function identified by the `RID`. The 
“Page Group Response” message is used by system hardware and/or software to 
communicate with the device functions page-request interface to signal 
completion of a “Page Request”, or the catastrophic failure of the interface.

If the `PV` operand is set to 1, the message is generated with a PASID TLP 
prefix with the PASID field set to the `PID` operand. 

The `PAYLOAD` operand of the command is used to form the message body. 

If the `DSV` operand is 1, then a valid destination segment number is specified 
by the `DSEG` operand.

=== Fault/Event-Queue (FQ)
Fault/Event queue is an in-memory queue data structure used to report events 
and faults raised when processing transactions. Each fault record is 64 bytes.

The PPN of the base of this in-memory queue and the size of the queue is 
configured into a memory-mapped register called fault-queue base (`fqb`).

The tail of the fault-queue resides in a IOMMU controlled read-only 
memory-mapped register called `fqt`.  The `fqt` is an index into the next fault 
record that IOMMU will write in the fault-queue. Subsequent to writing the 
record, the IOMMU advances the `fqt` by 1. The head of the fault-queue resides 
in a read/write memory-mapped software controlled register called `fqh`. The `fqh`
is an index into the next fault record that SW should process next. Subsequent
to processing fault record(s) software advances the `fqh` by the count of the 
number of fault records processed. If `fqh` == `fqt`, the fault-queue is empty. If
`fqt` == (`fqh` - 1) the fault-queue is full.

privilege of the transaction was Supervisor then `PRIV` bit is 1 else its 0.

If the `CAUSE` is guest-page fault then the guest-physical-address right shifted
by 2 is reported in `iotval[63:2]`. If bit 0 of `iotval2` 1, then guest-page-fault
was caused by an implicit memory access for VS-stage address translation. If 
bit 0 of `iotval2` is 1, and the implicit access was a write then bit 1 is set 
to 1 else its set to 0.

The IOMMU may be unable to report faults through the fault-queue due to error 
conditions such as the fault-queue being full or the IOMMU encountering access
faults when attempting to access the queue memory. A memory-mapped fault 
control and status register (`fqcsr`) holds information about such faults. If 
the fault-queue full condition is detected the IOMMU sets a fault-queue full 
(`fqof`) bit in fqcsr. If the IOMMU encounters a fault in accessing the 
fault-queue memory, the IOMMU sets a fault-queue memory access fault (`fqmf`) 
bit in fqcsr. While either error bits are set in fqcsr, the IOMMU discards 
the record that led to the fault and all further fault records. When an error 
bit is in the fqcsr changes state from 0 to 1 or when a new fault record is
produced in the fault-queue, fault interrupt pending (`fip`) bit is set in the 
`fqcsr`. 

=== Page-Request-Queue (PQ)
Page-request queue is an in-memory queue data structure used to report PCIe 
ATS “Page Request” messages to software. The base PPN of this in-memory queue 
and the size of the queue is configured into a memory-mapped register called 
page-request queue base (`pqb`).

The tail of the queue resides in a IOMMU controlled read-only memory-mapped 
register called `pqt`.  The `pqt` holds an index into the queue where the next 
page-request message will be written by the IOMMU. Subsequent to writing the 
message, the IOMMU advances the `pqt` by 1. 

The head of the queue resides in a software controlled read/write memory-mapped
register called `pqh`. The `pqh` holds an index into the queue where the next 
page-request message will be received by software. Subsequent to processing the
message(s) software advances the `pqh` by the count of the number of messages 
processed.

If `pqh` == `pqt`, the page-request queue is empty. 

If `pqt` == (`pqh` - 1) the page-request queue is full.

The IOMMU may be unable to report page-requests through the queue due to error
conditions such as the queue being full or the IOMMU encountering access faults
when attempting to access queue memory. A memory-mapped page-request queue 
control and status register (pqcsr) is used to hold information about such 
faults. If the queue full condition is detected, the IOMMU discards the 
message and may auto-complete the page-request as specified by the PCIe ATS 
specification. On a page queue full condition the page-request-queue overflow
(`pqof`) bit is set in `pqcsr`. If the IOMMU encountered a fault in accessing o
the queue memory, page-request-queue memory access fault (`pqmf`) bit in 
`pqcsr`. While either error bits are set in `pqcsr`, the IOMMU discards 
subsequent page-request messages and may auto-complete them using an IOMMU 
generated “Page Group Response” message as specified by PCIe ATS 
specifications.

When an error bit is in the pqcsr changes state from 0 to 1 or when a new 
message is produced in the queue, page-request-queue interrupt pending (`pip`) 
bit is set in the `pqcsr`.

The `DID` field holds the requester ID from the message. The `PID` field is 
valid if `PV` is 1 and reports the PASID from the PASID TLP prefix of the 
message. `PRIV` is set to 0 if the message did not have a PASID TLP prefix, 
otherwise it holds the “Privilege Mode Requested” bit from the PASID TLP 
prefix. `X` bit is set to 0 if the message did not have a PASID TLP prefix, 
otherwise it reports the “Execute Requested” bit from the PASID TLP prefix. All
other fields are set to 0. The payload of the “Page Request” message 
(bytes 0x08 through 0x0F of the message) is held in the `PAYLOAD` field.
